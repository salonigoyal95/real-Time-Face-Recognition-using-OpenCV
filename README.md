# real-Time-Face-Recognition-using-OpenCV
Developed real-time face recognition system using OpenCV. Phases: face detection, training the recognizer, and face recognition. Utilized Haar Cascade classifier for detection, trained OpenCV Recognizer with image dataset. Achieved accurate, real-time face recognition for diverse applications.

**#Description**
The project focuses on developing a real-time face recognition system using OpenCV. It involves three main phases: face detection and data gathering, training the recognizer, and face recognition. The system utilizes the Haar Cascade classifier for face detection and trains the OpenCV Recognizer with a dataset of positive and negative images. In the face recognition phase, the system captures a live face, compares it with the trained data, and predicts the probable owner with a confidence index. The project aims to achieve accurate and real-time face recognition capabilities for various applications.
